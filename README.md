# Music-PlayList-Java-InnerClass-Variant
The same music player simulator, only this time with an inner class instead of a member arrayList

Custom music playlist where the user can add songs from specific albums. 3 classes (Main(ofc), Album (with an inner class called SongList), Song), each with specific interconnected methods (private & public). My solution for Coding Exercise 46 (Java Programming MasterClass). Linked List practice. Implemented menu where user can exit, skip the song, go back to previous song, replay song, remove song from playlist and check the entire playlist
